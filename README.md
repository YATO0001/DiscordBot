# README

This is a Dicsord bot made for a few people I know and is built using npm version 3.5.2. 

To install and run the project use

`npm install`

and then 

`npm run`

If you intend to change the code `nodemon` is suggested as it auto restarts the project as changes are made.


## Thanks to
Quite a chunk of the code is copied and modified, some of it to a lesser degree, from https://anidiots.guide/first-bot/a-basic-command-handler, so thanks to the amazing resources there.
